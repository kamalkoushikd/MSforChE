<p>Learn more about the Materials Science Project.</p>

<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
    This project was built entirely from scratch, with all components — from the backend structure to the frontend design — developed from the ground up. All the data used in the project was carefully collected and processed to ensure accuracy and completeness. The project aims to make exploring element properties more interactive, including simulating <strong>XRD patterns</strong> using <strong>Plotly</strong>.
</p>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
    The project focuses on presenting detailed <strong>mechanical, optical, chemical, and physical properties</strong> of elements in an intuitive format. It also integrates advanced material science data such as <strong>XRD (X-ray Diffraction)</strong> patterns for sulfur (S<sub>8</sub>) using <strong>Bragg's equation</strong>, with interactive visualizations powered by <strong>Plotly</strong>.
</p>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
    The project is built using <strong>Django</strong> for the backend and leverages <strong>GSAP</strong> and <strong>D3.js</strong> for frontend animations and data visualization. The data is processed using <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, <strong>ASE</strong>, and <strong>pymatgen</strong> to provide accurate scientific insights.

            <p class="mt-1 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
                Kamal led the development of the app, building both the backend and frontend from scratch. He implemented the XRD simulation using <strong>pymatgen</strong> and integrated interactive charts using <strong>Plotly</strong>. He also configured the Django backend, handled data processing using <strong>NumPy</strong> and <strong>pymatgen</strong>, and deployed the app on <strong>AWS EC2</strong>, setting up the entire server infrastructure.
